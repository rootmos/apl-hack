# apl-hack
A place to collect things I learn about APL. Some [J](http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc) has snuck its way in there as well.

## Resources
* The implementation I'm using is [Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/)
  - their [documentation](https://www.dyalog.com/documentation_160.htm#CORE) was fully sufficient both to get started and continue improving
* Inspirations:
  - [no stinking loops](http://nsl.com/)
  - Check out the very well documented [dfns](https://dfns.dyalog.com/) library
  - [Co-dfns](https://github.com/Co-dfns/Co-dfns) (especially the links to [arcfide](https://github.com/arcfide)'s [papers and presentations](https://github.com/Co-dfns/Co-dfns#publications))
* Idiom lists:
  - [Dyalog's own list](http://docs.dyalog.com/14.0/Dyalog%20APL%20Idioms.pdf)
  - [The APL idiom list (1977)](http://cpsc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/tr87.pdf)
* For editor support I'm using [vim-apl](https://github.com/ngn/vim-apl) with [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime)

## Sources of interesting problems
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) ([my solutions](dyalog/euler))
* [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) ([my solutions](dyalog/aoc17) for [AoC17](http://adventofcode.com/2017))
  ([my solutions](https://github.com/rootmos/advent) for [AoC16](http://adventofcode.com/2016) are in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/))
